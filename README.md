# receipts-on-repeat-reloaded

## Description

Our motivation for creating Receipts on Repeat was to enhance the user experience for music lovers who want to keep track of their favorite playlists and the songs within them. We built this project to fill a gap in the Spotify user experience. Many users enjoy curating playlists but often struggle to communicate the contents of these playlists in a visually appealing way. Instead of sending links or screenshots, users can generate a formatted receipt that lists the playlist name, song titles, artists, and even album art. This makes sharing playlists more engaging and informative, allowing for better conversations about music. Through the development of this app, We learned valuable skills working with APIs, particularly the Spotify API, to fetch playlist data. We also gained experience in front-end development, focusing on user interface design to ensure the app is user-friendly and visually appealing. Additionally, We improved our collaboration skills by working with eachother, as developers we learned the importance of communication and task delegation in a team setting.
